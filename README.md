# Data-Science-Udacity-Capstone
This project is part of the Data Science Nanodegree at Udacity. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are used to classify dog breeds in this study. The algorithm will determine a dog's breed based on a photograph of the canine. If a human photograph is provided, the algorithm will identify the dog breed that most closely resembles it.
